1. We noticed that the URL changed and the word that I was looking for was defined by the website.
The URL structure always remains https://www.dictionary.com/browse/(WORD).

2. The website took my input and placed it into the form.
No word was found and the URL was changed to
(https://www.dictionary.com/misspelling?term=ertyguhijo)

3.The website acted wierdly and did not attempt to correct our "word".
Also the URL form of the search inputed was modified to represent special characters diffrently.

4.The "term" in the URL is the name of the variable from the form.
