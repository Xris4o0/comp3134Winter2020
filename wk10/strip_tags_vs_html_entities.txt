The two solutions handle the problem in different ways:

- HTML entities makes sure that the user input given to the server is translated
to HTML first then placed into the PHP page, which changes some of the special
characters to a specific %## codes and these codes are not recognized by the PHP interpreter.
The PHP interpreter is told specificaly that this string is a HTML and needs to be displayed
as such. Making any script tags not readable as javascript, but just as a string.


- The stripping of tags denies the chance for any tags to be inputted and injected into the
PHP page by changing the input string before placing it anywhere in the page.
