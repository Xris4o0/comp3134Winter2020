Should not be able to view files and folders before the /html directory.

Fixed by implimenting "if(strpos(realpath($path), '/html') !== false)" which checks if the path we are looking at has the '/html' string pathern..

Should not attempt to look at folders that do not exist.

Fixed by implimenting "if(!file_exists($path))".

BONUS, do not allow user to pass a filename

Fixed by implementing "strpos($_GET['q'], '.')" check at first if statement.
