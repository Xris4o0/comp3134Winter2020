Type: "Ben"

The query doesn't find any row with the firstname = Ben and active = 1.
It is as expected because active is set to = 0 in the table.

Type: "Ben'-- "

The query finds only the row with the firstname = Ben.
This was expected as the "-- " indicate comment in sql.
Allowing the user to bypass the active = 1 check.

Type: "Ben' or 1=1"

The query finds all rows even though the active = 0 on all rows inside the database.
This is because the logic ignored any of the previous statments and execused only the one that states 1=1.
