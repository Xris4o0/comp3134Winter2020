Type: "Ben"

The query doesn't find any row with the firstname = Ben and active = 1.
It is as expected because active is set to = 0 in the table.

Type: "Ben'-- "

The query doesn't find any row with the firstname = Ben'--  and active = 1.
This was expected as it doesnt make any sense to find anything.

Type: "Ben' or 1=1"

The query finds all rows even though the active = 0 on all rows inside the database.
This is because the logic ignored any of the previous statments and execused only the one that states 1=1.
